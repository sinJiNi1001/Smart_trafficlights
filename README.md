# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Light System (AnyLogic Simulation)

A simulation-based intelligent traffic control system built in **AnyLogic**, designed to optimize signal timings dynamically based on real-time vehicle density.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
- Simulates a 4-way intersection with varying traffic flow.
- Uses agent-based modeling to represent vehicles and signal logic.
- Dynamically adjusts green light durations to reduce congestion and wait times.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Tech
- Simulation Platform: **AnyLogic**  
- Logic: Agent-Based Modeling + Process Flow  
- Language: Java (used within AnyLogic for logic scripting)

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Real-time vehicle density detection  
- Adaptive traffic light control logic  
- Scalable to larger intersections or smart city models

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To demonstrate a data-driven approach to traffic management using simulation before deploying real-world systems.
